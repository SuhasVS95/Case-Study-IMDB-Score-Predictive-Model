# Case-Study-IMDB-Score-Predictive-Model

# Problem Statement
What makes movies good or bad? Is it its IMDb score? How does it get that score? Is it our emotional response towards them? Is it the critical reviews or the scores? Is it the amount they gross at the box office? What is it really that describes their success or failure? This project is an analysis done on various factors that might affect the imdb score of a movie and trying to predict the score based on those values.
